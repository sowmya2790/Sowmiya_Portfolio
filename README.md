<p align="left">    I am Sowmiya Muruganandam, I specialise in Operations,Program Management and Analytics. With an MBA and over five years of combined experience from a start up and India's largest bank, I've decided to explore the world of data! I want to be part of the data journey the world is going through, part of the transformation where the world is  filled with smart and ethical machines.
<br>I recently graduated from ASU's MS in Business Analytics program as a Summa cum laude and I am looking for a challenging role that will provide me an opportunity to use both my business and data skills </p>
